# Minecraft AZ--104 Quest Board

Hi! I'm a **Program Manager** learning as much as I can to change careers and become an **Azure Engineer**. It's important to me to build a solid foundation in:

- Azure Infrastructure  
- Bicep deployments  
- GitHub Actions CI/CD automation  

I'm also learning **Python** — not just to read it, but to confidently write it.

## Current Goal: Pass the AZ-104

I’m studying for the **AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator** exam (retake). I scored `661/700` on my first attempt — close, but not quite there. This time, I want to pass with confidence.

To stay motivated, I decided to combine **Minecraft** (which I enjoy) with studying — and even included my **preschooler** in the process. I built a Minecraft server using Azure to make learning hands-on and fun.

## Why Minecraft

If you enjoy Minecraft and want to learn Azure in a practical, hands-on way, this project may be a helpful starting point. It's a fun and effective way to build real skills while working on something meaningful.

## How to Navigate the Repo 

The folder structure is as follows:

- .github/workflows - Where you place your yaml logs
- configs
- minecraft-specifics
- quests
- resources
- yaml-files
- .DS_Store
- .Minecraft-AZ104-Quest-Board.md
- README.md
- yaml-files - The actual yaml files.  I did not want to put it in the .github/workflows so it wouldn't trigger a runner 
- .gitignore - Files to ignore

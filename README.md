# From Program Manager to Aspiring Azure Engineer

Hi! I'm a **Program Manager** learning as much as I can to change careers and become an **Azure Engineer**. It's important to me to build a solid foundation in:

- Azure Infrastructure  
- Bicep deployments  
- GitHub Actions CI/CD automation  

I'm also learning **Python** — not just to read it, but to confidently write it.

## Current Goal: Pass the AZ-104

I’m studying for the **AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator** exam (retake). I scored `661/700` on my first attempt — close, but not quite there. This time, I want to pass with confidence.

To stay motivated, I decided to combine **Minecraft** (which I enjoy) with studying — and even included my **preschooler** in the process. I built a Minecraft server using Azure to make learning hands-on and fun.

## Project Overview: Minecraft Server on Azure

Using **Bicep** and **GitHub Actions**, I created an automated pipeline to deploy a Minecraft server on an Ubuntu VM in Azure. This project helped me understand how real Azure infrastructure works — and how to build it using code.

### Key Resources I Used

- [Quickstart: Create an Ubuntu Linux virtual machine using a Bicep file](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-bicep?tabs=CLI)  
- [How to deploy your free private Minecraft server with Azure for Student?](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/educatordeveloperblog/how-to-deploy-your-free-private-minecraft-server-with-azure-for-student/3693328)

## Key Concepts I Learned

- Azure Bicep (Infrastructure as Code)  
- GitHub Actions – including linting, Azure CLI, and Bash scripting  
- YAML syntax and structure  
- SSH keys for secure authentication  
- PowerShell basics  
- User-assigned managed identities  
- Virtual networks and subnets  
- Network security groups (NSGs)

## Skills This Project Helped Me Build

- Writing YAML for GitHub workflows  
- Automating deployments with DevOps pipelines  
- Getting a GitHub Actions runner up and running  
- Using and managing SSH keys  
- Starting with Bicep syntax and modules  
- Troubleshooting scripts, templates, and pipeline errors  
- Debugging CI/CD issues in real-time  
- Learning how Azure components like VMs, networking, and identities fit together

## What's Next

I plan to continue expanding this project to include more AZ-104 topics such as:

- Storage accounts  
- Monitoring and metrics  
- Backups and recovery services

## Project Overview: Minecraft Server on Azure

Using **Bicep** and **GitHub Actions**, I created an automated pipeline to deploy a Minecraft server on an Ubuntu VM in Azure. This project helped me understand how real Azure infrastructure works — and how to build it using code.

### Key Resources I Used

- [Quickstart: Create an Ubuntu Linux virtual machine using a Bicep file](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-bicep?tabs=CLI)  
- [How to deploy your free private Minecraft server with Azure for Student?](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/educatordeveloperblog/how-to-deploy-your-free-private-minecraft-server-with-azure-for-student/3693328)
